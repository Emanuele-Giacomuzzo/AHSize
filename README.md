# Ecosystem size tunes the spatial feedback between autotrophic and heterotrophic ecosystems.

The connection between autotrophic and heterotrophic ecosystems (e.g., the connection between a lake and a forest) can impact their biomass and biodiversity. However, it is uncertain if the size of the ecosystems has any effect on this connection. For example, what would happen if instead of having a lake and a forest of the same size the lake or the forest was larger? Here, we examined how differences in ecosystem size affected the impact of spatial feedback on the biodiversity and functioning of two-patch meta-ecosystems that were connected through non-living resource flows in a protist experiment. We found that when the autotrophic patch was larger, the connection between the patches led to an increase in the total biomass of the meta-ecosystem. Conversely, when the heterotrophic patch was larger, the connection resulted in a decrease in the total biomass of the meta-ecosystem. We also observed that ecosystem size played a critical role in determining the effects of the connection at a local (ecosystem) level. Our findings reveal that differences in patch sizes can significantly influence biodiversity and function in cross-ecosystem dynamics among ecosystems of varying types.
